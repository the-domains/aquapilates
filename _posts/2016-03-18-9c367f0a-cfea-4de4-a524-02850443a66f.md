Peyow Aqua Pilates

(pee-yow' ) is derived from the Mandarin word for "float". 

"Think yoga crossed with gentle calisthenics, circus acrobatics, and the occasional muscle burn of weightlifting.  Expect a hearty abdominal workout while twisting into positions possible only in the water, a boon that will bring flexibility to your hamstrings and lats."
