[CASE STUDIES 2015 - PEYOW AQUA PILATES: ][0]

[CHANGES IN DYNAMIC BALANCE WITHIN PARTICIPANTS ][0]

[WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES ][0]

Introduction/Background /Objectives:
The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of Peyow
Aqua Pilates exercises on land-based static and dynamic balance
for participants with disabilities and chronic conditions. 

Data & Methods:
The pilot group were participants at the Rehabilitation Institute of
Chicago, medically cleared for group aquatics and independently
able to enter/exit the pool. Four standardized tests were
administered from Aug 2012 -- Jan 2015 on 40 subjects. Classes
consisted of 1 class per week, 45 min. duration in a warm water
therapy pool (90ÂºF), 4.5'-5.0' in depth. Subjects were tested at
week 1, and every 11 weeks following. Seven case studies were
chosen for presentation with ages ranging from 52-75; these
participants presented with arthritis, lupus, fibromyalgia,
lymphedema, spinal stenosis, multiple sclerosis, and lumbar fusion.
These participants attended over 17 classes, within two consecutive
11 week series', without major surgery, hospitalization or illness.
Participants missing more than 4 consecutive weeks were not
included. Each individual was tested in the following ways: 

The Forward Functional Reach Test
Quick screen for determining fall risk in older adults
The Forward Functional Reach Test was taken 3 times, averaging
the 2nd and 3rd attempt together to produce the final number.
Subjects start position was standing vertical with arms extended to
the front, at the zero mark of a wall-mounted measuring tape. They
bent forward at the hips and reached out along the wall as far as
possible.
Test Criteria: 10 in. =1
6-10in = 2

The Single Leg Stance Test
Single leg assessment of standing balance
The Single Leg Stance was a timed stance of 30 seconds. For the
single leg stance, the subject stood on one leg of their choice.
Test Criteria: Cut point of 

The Tandem Leg Stance Test
Assessment for static balance with narrow base of support
The Tandem Leg Stance was a timed stance of 30 seconds. For the
tandem leg stance, the subject placed one foot with the heel
touching the toe of the second leg, choosing which leg was forward.
On both leg tests, if they touched the wall or the floor or fell out of
balance the timing would stop.
Test Criteria: Cut Point of 

The 360 Degree Turn Protocol Test
Standard assessment of dynamic balance
The 360 Degree Turn Protocol was timed twice. Subject was told to
turn around once as fast as they could and stop at the same point.
This was done twice averaging the data.
Test Criteria: Cut point of 3.8 indicator of fall risk.  

Conclusion & Implications:
All the participants displayed 10%-62% increases in Forward
Frontal Reach Test measurements, and at the end of the study
each participant could reach past the cut point of 10 inches,
indicating core strength, and dynamic balance. 

The static balance tests: Single Leg Stance and Tandem Leg
Stance elicited mixed results. Participants using walkers or
canes, demonstrated better results on the Tandem Leg Stance
balance test. The cut point for fall risk in the Single Leg Stance
is less than 5 seconds. Based on test criteria, 5 of the 7 case
study participants were still at risk for falling. The cut point for
the Tandem Leg Stance is twice as long. According to test
criteria, only 1 person was at risk for falling after taking the
course. The Tandem Leg Stance test may be an appropriate
indicator of falls for those participants that use walking devices
or power mobility devices in daily life, and are testing without
these devices. 

The 360 Degree Turn Protocol is highly correlated with gait
speed and dynamic balance. The results of this test varied
greatly, from 62% faster to 28% slower. At the end of the
study, all 7 subjects were faster than the cut point for fall risk -
greater than 3.8 seconds. 

The seven case studies demonstrate an increase in core
strength and dynamic stability for people with disabilities and
chronic conditions. More studies are needed to determine
static and dynamic stability gains/losses. 

Applications to Practice:
Peyow Aqua Pilates seems to be applicable for increasing core
strength and dynamic balance in special populations that may
or may not be able to do Pilates exercises on land. This
aquatic intervention could make Pilates exercise classes more
accessible to a wider variety of populations.
Peyow Aqua Pilates exercise adaptations may be a safe and
beneficial environment for training persons with multiple
disabilities in a group setting or post-rehab as a continuum of
care for patients.
Patients with spinal injuries (compressions, surgeries, fusions,
scoliosis, osteoporosis, and osteopenia) can safely strengthen
the spinal and core stabilizers. The Peyow Aqua Pilates
method may be beneficial to patients with multiple sclerosis
and lupus without over-taxation. This may be a protective
method for hypermobile patients as they learn to brake prior to
hyperextension with the controlled Pilates movements.
In a younger or general population, group classes of Pilates in
the water could make a broader range of this modality more
affordable and readily available for university students, as well
as increase kinesthetic postural awareness.
